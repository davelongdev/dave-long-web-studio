<h1 class='txt-center'>About</h1> 

{{< headshot >}}

<p>I'm a computer programmer and a writer with an artistic eye. I'm focused on
web development and building web sites.  I'm also a small business owner.</p>

<br>

<p>I'm interested in using my skills and background to help others start a new
business or scale up an existing one by developing their presense on the
internet.</p>

<br>

<p>I have a broad background that encompasses working in tech, law, music, and
teaching.  I also have a wide variety of skills and interests.</p> 

<br>

<h2>Web Development and Computer Progremming</h2>

<p>I've also studied and worked as a freelancer in computer programming and web
development.  I've been focusing on front-end web development, which involves
writing code that's applied to the what's called the 'front-end' of web sites -
the aspects of web sites that people interact with on a daily basis.  Front end
development primarily involves working with languages like javascript, html,
and css, and I've spent a lot of time working with and learning about these
languages.  I'm also familiar with back-end development, which involves working
with databases, networkin, and application programming interfaces or APIs.
Back-end development often involves working
with languages like python and go.</p> 


<br>

<h2>Writing</h2>

<p>I have been writing in English all my life.  I grew up speaking english as a
first language.  In college, I majored in philosphy and explored topics such as
natrual language philosophy, mathematical logic, and philosophy of science.  I
later went to law school and practiced law with a focus on legal research and
writing. I also have expeience in writing english content for web sites. In my
spare time, I enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction.</p> 

<br/>

<h2>Music Teaching and Running a Business</h2>

<p>For the last few years, I've been running my own business teaching music
lessons online and in person.  I built the business up though a lot of hard
work and dedication, but it all started by making a website.  Although, I've
gotten many students over the years through things like networking, word of
mounth, and referrals, most of my students have found me online through my web
site.  The process of scaling up this business has taught me the importance of
building a presense on the web, and it has ispired me to help others build a
new business or grow an existing one.  It has also given me the opportunity to
work with the web and learn and work with the tools necessary to become
sucessful online.</p>
