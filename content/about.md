{{< headshot >}}

I'm a computer programmer and a writer with an artistic eye. I'm focused on
web development and building web sites.  I'm also a small business owner.

<br>

I'm interested in using my skills and background to help others start a new
business or scale up an existing one by developing their presense on the
internet.

<br>

I have a broad background that encompasses working in tech, law, music, and
teaching.  I also have a wide variety of skills and interests.

<br>

## Web Development and Computer Progremming

I'm currently focused on working as a freelancer in computer programming and
web development.  I've been focusing on front-end web development, which
involves writing code that's applied to the what's called the 'front end' of
web sites - the aspects of web sites that people see and interact with on a daily
basis.

<br>

Front-end development primarily involves working with languages
like javascript, html, and css, and I've spent a lot of time working with and
learning about these languages.  Css is used to shape the styling of a web page
`-` things like colors, shapes, and text size.  Html is used to set up the
structure of a page, e.g., by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, and
lists.  Javascript is a programming language that can be used to add
functionality and interactivity to a site.

<br>

I'm also familiar with back-end development, which involves working with
databases, networking, and application programming interfaces or APIs. Back-end
development often involves working with computer languages like python, php, and
go.

<br>

## Writing

I've been writing in English all my life.  I grew up speaking english as my
primary language.  In college, I majored in philosphy and explored topics such
as natrual language philosophy and logic.  I later went to law school and
practiced law with a focus on legal research and writing. I also have expeience
writing content for web sites.  I've written articles and blog posts, for
example, and I've developed the written content for entire sites. In my spare
time, I enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction.

<br>

## Music Teaching and Running a Business

For the last few years, I've been running my own business teaching music
lessons online and in person.  I built the business up though a lot of hard
work and dedication, but it all started by making a website.  Although, I've
gotten many students over the years through avenues like networking, word of
mounth, and referrals, most of my students have found me online through my web
site.  The process of scaling this business up has taught me the importance of
building a presense on the web, and it has inspired me to help others build and
grow their businesses.  It has also given me the opportunity to work with the
web and learn about and work with the tools necessary to become sucessful
online.
