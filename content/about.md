{{< headshot >}}

I'm a computer programmer and a writer with an artistic eye. I'm currently focused on web development and building
websites. I'm also a small business owner.

I'm interested in using my skills and background to help others start a new
business or scale up an existing business by developing their presense on the
internet.

I have a broad background that encompasses working in tech, law, music, and
teaching.  I also have a wide variety of skills and interests.

## Web Development and Computer Progremming

I'm currently working as a freelancer in computer programming and
web development.  I've recently been focusing on front-end web development, which
involves writing code that's applied to the what's called the 'front end' of
websites - the aspects of websites that people see and interact with on a daily
basis.

Front-end development primarily involves working with languages
like javascript, html, and css, and I've spent a lot of time working with and
learning about these languages.  CSS is used to shape the styling of a web page
`-` things like colors, shapes, and text size.  HTML is used to create the
structure of a page, e.g., by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, and
lists.  Javascript is a programming language that can be used to add
functionality and interactivity to a site.

I'm also familiar with back-end web development, which involves working with
databases, networking, and application programming interfaces or APIs. Back-end
development often involves working with computer languages like python, php, and
go.

## Writing

I've been writing in English all my life. I grew up speaking english as my primary language. In college, I majored in
philosphy and explored topics such as natrual language philosophy, reasoning and argumentation, and logic. I later went
to law school and practiced law with a focus on legal research and writing. I also have expeience writing content for
websites. I've written many different articles and blog posts, for example, and I've developed the written content for
entire sites. In my spare time, I enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction.

## Music Teaching and Running a Business

For the last few years, I've been running my own business teaching music lessons online and in person. I built this
business up though a lot of hard work and dedication, but it all started by making a website. Although I've found many
students over the years through avenues like networking, word of mounth, and referrals, most of my students have found
me online through my web site. The process of scaling this business up has taught me the importance of building a
presense on the web, and it has inspired me to help others build and grow their businesses. It has also given me the
opportunity to work with the web and learn about and work with the tools necessary to become sucessful online.
