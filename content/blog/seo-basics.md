## What is SEO?

SEO stands for search engine optimization.  It means optomizing your web site to improve how it shows up in search
results.  These days, at least in the US, the most important search engine by far is google, so the majority of your efforts
when it comes to SEO for the US market should be focused on google search. 

Probably the most important aspect of SEO is getting your site ranked near the top of the list of google search results.
There are other aspects of SEO too, though, such as shaping how your business and web site information shows up in
search results. For example, you can affect what the search result for your business actually says and how it's
displayed on the search engine results page (SERP). You can also influence how your business or web site shows up in a
google maps search.
 
## What are the Most Important Parts of SEO?

### 1 - Write High Quality Content that's Relevant to your Business and Helpful to Your Customers.

There's no substute for good content when it comes to SEO. Google's process for ranking web sites for searches is very
sophisticated these days. You can't just string together a bunch of keywords and expect to get great SEO results. It's
important that a website's written content makes sense in the overall context of your site and is readable and
meaningful to potential customers.

### 2 - Cover the Topics that are Most Important to your Customers.

Try to write about issues realating to your business that are likely to interest your potential customers. Think about
what questions they might have regarding your business that you could try to help them with. What kinds of things might
they be searching for answers about on google? By covering various topics relevant to your customers, you're creating
content that google potentially use as a search result. Further, you're also demonstraiting your knowledge about your
business and providing them with helpful information.

## What Other Factors are Important for SEO?

the following:

- Accessibility
- Site Performance
- Google Business Listing

## Should I Make a Google Business Profile?

It's a good idea to set up a google business profile for your business. Once your profile is set up, google can use it
to display information about your business in web browser search results and in google maps searches. You can set up a
google business profile for free, so it makes sense to set one up for your business.

## Can I Improve my SEO?

While it's quite difficult to try to rank well in search results in a nation-wide or global search for very broad search
terms, you can see good results by working on your SEO if you narrow your focus. One of the best ways to acheive good
SEO results is to focus on a local area. Sometimes, for example, people add 'near me' to their searches. Another way you
might narrow your focus is to create content for and offer a very specific kind of product or service. How effective you
can be by working on your SEO really depends on how much work you put in to your SEO strategy (and your business in
general) and the competition in your specific area of focus.

## How Important is Site Performance in SEO?

Site performance is one of the factors that google considers when determining where to rank your site or page in the
search results for a given search. It's difficult to say for sure exactly how much google weighs various factors in
their ranking procedure as they don't disclose that information publicly, but they have indicated that site performance
is definitely a factor.

## What is Site Performance?

Generally speaking, site performance relates to how fast your website is. For example, does it take 6 seconds to the
homepage to appear in your browser when somone tries to access your site, or does it take less than 1 second? If your
site is slow, it's bad for SEO, but it's also a bad user experience. Having a site that's fast and snappy makes your
business look and feel more professional and competant, whereas having a slow or sluggish site does the opposite.

## How can I improve my Site's Performance?

There are many ways to improve your site's performance. Often, one of the best ways to do so is by optomizing your
images. If your images are very large, that can impact your site performance score. Often, better site performance
scores can be obtained by using image formats that are optomized for the web or have smaller file sizes. Another way to
improve site performance is to minimize the size of other files like video or sound files.
