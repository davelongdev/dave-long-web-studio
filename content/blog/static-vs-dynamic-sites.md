<h1 class='txt-center'>Static vs. Dynamic Web Sites</h1> 

<br>

<h2>What is a Static Web Site?</h2>

<p>A static web site is a type of web site that appears the same for anyone who comes to look at the site. For example,
  a business may want to create a static site for advertising, marketing, or informational purposes, and it may not need
  to create customized content for individual customers.</p>

<br>

<p>A static site is basically made up of a few different components: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML lays out the
  structure of the pages, CSS is responsible for styline, and Javascript allows for interactivity (things like drop down
  menus).</p>

<br>

<h2>What is a Dynamic Web Site?</h2>

<p>A dynamic web site is a site that generates and displays different content for different people. Examples of dynamic web sites are
  twitter, facebook, and banking web sites. Theses kinds of sites have a login system, and they create a unique experience
  for each user.</p>

<br>

<h2>Should I make a Static Site or a Dynamic Site?</h2>

<p>Whether or not to build your web site as static or dynamic really depends on your business needs. For many small
  businesses that are just getting started, a static site may be a great fit. If you are planning to have an online
  store, or if you need to set your customers up with their own accounts so that they can post photos or view their
  transactions, you may be better off with a dynamic site.</p>

<br>

<p>Nowadays, the line between static and dynamic can be somewhat blurry. You could, for example, have a mostly static site
  with some dynamic interactivity like a form, a calendar, or a payment portal.</p>

<br>

<h2>What is a static site generator?</h2>

<p>A static site generator or SSG is a piece of software that facilitates the process of creating and managing a static
  site. SSGs provide, among other things, helpful automation and templating features.</p>
