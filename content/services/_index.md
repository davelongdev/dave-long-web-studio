## Consulting and Advising

There are many different ways to go about making a website these days. There are website builders like squarespace and
wix, static site generators, and content management systems like WordPress. I'm available to help you navigate the
different options. I've built a number of websites myself, and I'm well-versed in the technical site of websites.

<br>

If you'd like someone on your team who's knowledgable about the technical aspects of websites, even if you're planning
to do some or most of the work on your site yourself or inhouse.

## Writing

The writing on a website is usually a big part of the site's content. Content might also include thing like images,
videos, and audio, but writing usually plays a key role on any site. The site's writing can set the tone of the site, help
people get to know you or your business, and convey information about the products and services you offer. It can also
be a big help with SEO. In fact, written text is the primarily thing that search engines like google use to make
decisions about what search results to show for for any given search.

<br>

I'm an experienced writer, and I'd be happy to work with you to help you craft the written content on your site. I
can you put together writing for your site's various pages, any blog posts and articles, and advertising and marketing
materials.
