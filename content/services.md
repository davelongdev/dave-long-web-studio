## Static & Hybrid Sites

Static sites are sites that appear the same to all Users. They can be very fast to load, especially if you use them
in conjunction with a content delivery network like Cloudflare. If you're making a relatively small site, such as a
marketing site for a small business, you may be best off with a static site.
