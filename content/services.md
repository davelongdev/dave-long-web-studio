## Squarespace

Many people make thier fist website using a website builder like squarespace or wix.  These services offer a web portal in which you can use existing templates and create websites without knowing any computer programming or web development.  Even so, sometimes, it's nice to have a little help or advice on things like design, search engine optimization (seo), and website performance.
