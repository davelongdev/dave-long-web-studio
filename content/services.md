## Web Site Builders

Many people make thier fist website using a website builder like Squarespace, Wix, Webflow, or Canva. Services like
these offer a web portal in which you can use existing templates and create a website without knowing any computer
programming. Even so, sometimes, it's nice to have some help or advice on things programming, writing content, website
design, search engine optimization (SEO), or website performance.

<br>

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in creating a site that you can manage yourself on a website builder like
squarespace or wix, and you'd like some help or advice.

<br>

## Static & Hybrid Sites

Static sites are sites that appear the same to all users. They can be very fast to load, especially if you use them
in conjunction with a content delivery network (CDN) like Cloudflare. If you're making a relatively small site, such as a
marketing or informational site for a small business, you might be really happy with a static site. Even if your site
may need to include some dynamic elements like a calendar, user comments, or a payment portal, you still might want to
consider a static or hybrid site.

<br>

A hybrid site is a website that's primarily or at least partially made up of static components. A site like this can benifit from
the speed and performance benefits of a static site, while also allowing for some dynamic functionality where it's
needed or desired.

<br>

If you're interested in building a static site with a static site generator like Hugo, Astro, or Eleventy, or if your're
interested in discussing a hybird site, please get in touch.

<br>

## WordPress Sites

WordPress is another popular option that people may consider when building a website for themselves or their business.
If you're thinking about WordPress, it's important to know that wordpress.com and wordpress.org are two
differeent things. Wordpress.com is a website builder like Squarespace, Webflow, or Wix. Wordpress.org is an
open-source content management system (a CMS).

<br>

A content management system is a platform (often a web site or web portal) that allows you to manage and update the
content of your site without knowing computer programming. In this way, a CMS is similar to a website builder. Often
when people talk about WordPress, they are taling about the wordpress.org CMS, and that's what I mean when I talk about
WordPress on this site.

<br>

WordPress may be a good option for you or your business if your site needs extended functionality beyond what a static
site or hybrid site can offer. If you're comfortable with technology and computers, but you don't know computer
programming, you might be able to set up or maintain a WordPress site on your own. Creating and maintining a WordPress
stie is a bit more complicated and takes a a bit more work than using a site builder, but it can also provide more
flexibility and control. Given the added complexity of building and running a WordPress site, many people choose to get
help from a professional when creating or maintaining a Wordpress site.

<br>

WordPress is very popular these days. Somewhere around 40% of today's websites use it. Like anything, it has its
benefits and drawbacks. For example, there are many WordPress plugins available that allow you to add varuios features
to your site like SEO management, form building, search functionality, or analytics. It's also possible to build a
custom plugin for your site. On the other hand, these plugins need to be managed and updated from time to time. Feel
free to get in touch if you're interested in discussing setting up or maintaining a site with WordPress.

## Writing Services

The writing on a website is usually a big part of the site's content. Content might also include thing like images,
videos, and audio, but writing usually plays a key role on any site. The site's writing can set the tone of the site, help
people get to know you or your business, and convey information about the products and services you offer. It can also
be a big help with SEO. In fact, written text is the primarily thing that search engines like google use to make
decisions about what search results to show for for any given search.

<br>

I'm an experienced writer, and I'd be happy to work with you to help you craft the written content on your site. I
can you put together writing for your site's various pages, any blog posts and articles, and advertising and marketing
materials.
